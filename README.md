# interview_questions
### Question 2b:
For this Question I used the data from the github which shoed a normal distribution with the mean at approximatly 23.0361 and the standard deviation at 2.99 or 3. You can tell this is a normal distribition since the mean and median look like they would be in the same are so the distribution has a definite point or mountain figure.
## Non coding questions
### Question 3 : 
In this case I would use python pandas to impute null valuse into the column of a file since it would be easier to use the replace function in pandas to be able to switch empty columns with null. I would not use excel to do this just because it would be harder to acess the different parts of the column. I would also use SQL since it is not very hard to access values ina collumn to be able to switch out for null. I would not use excel to do this just because it would be harder to acess the different parts of the column.
### Question 4:
To be able to run the code every Thursday at 2:00am, python would be the program to use since you can use the schedule.every() and you can place an date and time to run a function that would impute those null values. This allows you not to have to run the code and it will always be doing it at that date or time once you run the code
### Question 5:
A data scientist that I look up to is a youtuber named Ken Jee since I have learned alot from his experience this past year with how to become a data scientist. The positive enviroment that he created on his channel for learning about the field and how to get involved in it has guided me though my career in data science thus far. Although he does not recieve too much views on his videos, I really appreciate his willingness to give back the up and coming class of future data scientist. This has driven me to want to give back in the future and possibly talk about my story on Youtube one day to help out any other students I can.
