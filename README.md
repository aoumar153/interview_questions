 ###Question 2b:
For this Question I used the data from the github provided which showed a normal distribution with the mean at approximately 23.0361 and the standard deviation at 2.99 or 3. You can tell this is a normal distribution since the mean and median look like they would be in the same area so the distribution has a definite point or mountain figure.
## Non coding questions
### Question 3 : 
In this case I would use python pandas to impute null value into the column of a file since it would be easier to use the replace function in pandas to be able to switch empty columns with null. I would not use excel to do this just because it would be harder to access the different parts of the column. I would also use SQL since it is not very hard to access values in a column to be able to switch out for null. I would not use excel to do this just because it would be harder to access the different parts of the column.
### Question 4:
To be able to run the code every Thursday at 2:00am, python would be the program to use since you can use the schedule.every.thursday.at() and you can place a date and time to run a function that would impute those null values. This allows you not to have to run the code and it will always be doing it at that date or time once you run the code
### Question 5:
A data scientist that I look up to is a youtuber named Ken Jee since I have learned alot from his experience this past year with how to become a data scientist. The positive environment that he created on his channel for learning about the field and how to get involved in it has guided me through my career in data science thus far. Although he does not receive too many views on his videos, I really appreciate his willingness to give back to the up and coming class of future data scientists. Another thing I appreciate is that he showcases different people in the industry through his podcasts that share their own experiences of getting into the industry. This has driven me to want to give back in the future and possibly talk about my story on Youtube one day to help out any other students I can. I would like to be a mentor to computer science in the future so I could give back especially to minorities because I would like to see more representation in our computer science field.
